                                    Songkran is a Thai traditional New Year which starts on April 13 every year and
                                    lasts for
                                    3 days.
                                    Songkran festival on April 13 is Maha Songkran Day or the day to mark the end of the
                                    old
                                    year,
                                    April 14 is Wan Nao which is the day after and April 15 is Wan Thaloeng Sok which
                                    the
                                    New Year begins.
                                    Songkran means “movement” or “changing” since according to Thai astrology, the sun
                                    will
                                    move into a new sign of the Zodiac on this day.
                                    Songkran is also called the “Water Festival”. Water is believed to flow and wash
                                    away
                                    all bad omens during this time.
                                    Thus, it is a time for cleaning; houses, villages, temples and spirit houses. In the
                                    Thai tradition, the New Year begins early in the morning when faithful Thai
                                    Buddhists
                                    give alms to Buddhist monks.
                                    After that, they release caged animals, especially birds and fish. Elders and
                                    parents
                                    will be visited and respected by their children and grandchildren.
                                    The young pour scented water over their elder’s hands, they in return, wish them
                                    good
                                    health, happiness and prosperity. This tradition of paying respect, is called “Rod
                                    Nam
                                    Dam Hua”. April 14 is called “Family Day”.

                                    Loy Krathong Day is one of the most popular festivals of Thailand celebrated
                                    annually on
                                    the Full-Moon Day of the Twelfth Lunar Month. It takes place at a time when the
                                    weather
                                    is fine as the rainy season is over and there is a high water level all over the
                                    country.
                                    The word “Loy” means “to float”, and “Krathong” means lotus-shaped vessel made of
                                    banana
                                    leaves. Loy Krathong is, therefore the floating of an illuminated leaf bowl. But
                                    nowadays some krathongs are made of coloured paper.
                                    A krathong usually contains a candle, three joss sticks, some flowers and coins. The
                                    history of Loy Krathong Festival is slightly obscure. First, it is to ask for
                                    apology
                                    from the water goddess for having used and sometimes made rivers and canals dirty.
                                    Second, it is to offer flowers, candles and joss sticks as a tribute to the
                                    footprint of
                                    Lord Buddha on the sandy beach of the Nammatha River in India. Third, it is to show
                                    gratitude to the Phra Mae Kong Ka or Mother of Water. Fourth, it is to wash away the
                                    previous year’s misfortunes.
                                    The ceremony is believed to have originated in the time of King Ramkhamhaeng of
                                    Sukhothai, the first capital of Thailand, and to have been started by Nang Nophamas
                                    or
                                    Tao Sri Chulalak, the Brahman consort of the King. She was the first person who
                                    introduced “Krathongcherm”, the banana leaf krathong in the form of lotus blossom on
                                    the
                                    festival night.
                                    The festival starts in the evening when there is a full moon in the sky. People
                                    carry
                                    their krathongs to the river and canals.
                                    After lighting candles and joss sticks and making a wish, they gently place the
                                    krathongs on the water and let them drift away till they go out of sight.
                                    It is believed that krathongs carry away their sins and bad luck, and happiness will
                                    come to them. Indeed, it is the time to be joyful and happy as the sufferings are
                                    floated away.

                                    Bun Bang Fai Festival, or the sixth lunar month merit-making, was traditionally held
                                    for only two days, with the first dedicated to the bang fai parades, and the second
                                    to the launching of the rockets.
                                    If a village decided to organise a Bun Bang Fai event, nearby villages would be
                                    invited to join and bring their rockets.
                                    On the evening of the first day, the host and the participating villagers would
                                    parade their rockets to the temple grounds where the event was held. This was a
                                    joyful activity showing harmony and solidarity among the villages.
                                    The parades included the Bang Fai dance and performances imitating the villagers’
                                    way of life such as fish net weaving and trap making.
                                    There were also jokes and songs with sexual innuendo. Wood carvings in the shape of
                                    a penis known as ‘buk paen’ (บักแป้น) or ‘palad khik’ (ปลัดขิก) were carried in the
                                    processions.
                                    It has been explained that these objects are symbols of the relationship between
                                    heaven and earth, and men and women, of the life-generating force and the power of
                                    fertility.
                                    The next day, the villagers, both men and women, the hosts and the guests, dressed
                                    in their finest and brought food and other offerings to the monks at the temple.
                                    After that, the rockets were taken out to the yard, where platforms were erected to
                                    mount them. Once all the rockets had been fired into the sky, the Bun Bang Fai
                                    festival for that year was considered at an end.

                                    “Khon", The performance of the highest level of Dramatic Works of Thai culture, is
                                    composed of various parts of The Country’s Legacy in artistic works such as Art
                                    Created Language, Fine Arts, Arts of playing Music, Dancing and Acting Arts. Hence,
                                    it is the most valuable and the most influential to Thai’s Arts and Cultures. This
                                    also shows that Thailand has been a highly civilized country that could conserve
                                    this valuable Legacy and passed on it to many generations until today, under the
                                    royal patronage of The Thai Monarchy. The Clear result is the Royally conferred
                                    “Khon” performances by HM. the Queen Sirikit which has been performed every year
                                    since the year 2009. Although, “Khon” has been developed, re-arranged and changed
                                    due to the development of Thai Social and Culture consistently; it still keeps its
                                    main format and the way of its performance with the main story of the Legend of
                                    Ramayana story. The performing format of Khon has been conserved and developed
                                    regularly. According to records, Khon used to be performed as KhonKlangPlang,
                                    KhonRongNorg, KhonNungRarw, KhonRongNai, Khon Na Jor, and KhonCharg, Once age and
                                    social changes have affected the art and culture into 2 significations, Khon reduced
                                    its role and importance. At the same time this affects the development of display
                                    formats such as KhonSalaChalermkrung, the Royal conferred “Khon”
